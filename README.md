# Math Facts Worksheet Generator

You can find this code live at https://mathfor.fun

Should vibe coding be banned?! Nah. I don't know web JS scripting. I'm not planning to learn it.

My daughter has been having difficulty in math because her command of math facts is a bit weak. My stepdad, Paul, was an elementary school math teacher. So Paul ( retired now ) sent me his MS Excel spreadsheet of math facts worksheets he used with his kids. I had some niggles about the formatting and wasn't liking the spreadsheet format. You can see that worksheet here on Google Sheets. I went looking for math fact worksheets to print out for my daughter and encountered a hellscape of banner ads and what not, or downloadable PDFs on etsy for $5.

I wondered: Can ChatGPT could produce a functioning web-app to generate math worksheets? 

I spent about 20 minutes in Chat GPT getting the prompt right, and quickly achieved what I wanted in terms of a math worksheet generator to help with math facts study. Old school grind it out with a pencil and paper style!

Once I had a working JavaScript from ChatGPT's o3-mini-high, I had it create separate CS and JS files, and optimize the JS code however it saw fit. I don't know web JS, but I know enough to fix a few small bugs in variable names. And I know HTML and CSS from the last millenia. So, I made a some CSS changes for printed document aesthetic.

I put the source code on GitHub ( about 3 minutes) and hosted it on AWS's nifty Amplify ( which I've never used before, about 5 minutes ). I registered a domain for $3 on hover.com ( 3 minutes). I think writing this post took the longest. Didn't use the LLM for that.

And voila! Meet: mathfor.fun 

I'll make some HTML edits, and point google at it. Hopefully this helps other parents or teachers.

P.S. If you finish a sheet in under 3 minutes, you deserve a treat.
